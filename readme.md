## Overview
A database of climbs created in the Seattle Bouldering Project's training area called "The Dojo." Users can create accounts and new content using the imgur API. Users can filter climbs by difficulty, style, and by who created them. Once users have uploaded a climb they have the option to edit or delete their climbs

## Technical Requirements






- Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) -- ideally a user model and one that represents the main functional idea for your app
- Include sign up/log in functionality, with hashed passwords & an authorization flow
- Incorporate at least one API. Examples include Yelp, Tumblr, Facebook, and others on Mashape.
- Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
- Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and interact with your relationally-stored data

- Have semantically clean HTML and CSS
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public

## Unsolved Problems
It is currently cumbersome for users to effectively upload images. They have to take a picture and find a way to circle holds in the image then they can upload to the page. Ideally there would be a tool in the app for users to mark holds.

## Future Work
There are two major features that I'd like to add: the ability for users to add climbs to a logbook and to add climbs to a favorite list.
